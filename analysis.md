## key passages
**1.the man has many rules to "an Ideal wife"**

It describes the man’s naivety and fastidiousness, laying the groundwork for the later “overturning” of his wife’s image.

*"So painfully acute was my sense of female imperfection, and such varied excellence did I require in the woman whom I could love, that there was an awful risk of my getting no wife at all or of being driven to perpetrate matrimony with my own image in the looking-glass. Besides the fundamental principle already hinted at, I demanded the fresh bloom of youth, pearly teeth, glossy ringlets, and the whole list of lovely items, with the utmost delicacy of habits and sentiments, a silken texture of mind, and, above all, a virgin heart. In a word, if a young angel just from Paradise, yet dressed in earthly fashion, had come and offered me her hand, it is by no means certain that I should have taken it."*

**2.The descriptions of the “monstrous” wife employ highly exaggerated metaphors**

This creates a sharp contrast with her earlier idealized image and highlights the dramatic reversal in her portrayal.

*"The blows were given by a person of grisly aspect with a head almost bald and sunken cheeks, apparently of the feminine gender, though hardly to be classed in the gentler sex. There being no teeth to modulate the voice, it had a mumbled fierceness-not passionate, but stern-which absolutely made me quiver like calves’-foot jelly."*

**3.

*“Ought a woman to disclose her frailties earlier than the wedding-day? Few husbands, I assure you, make the discovery in such good season, and still fewer complain that these trifles are concealed too long. Well, what a strange man you are! Poh! you are joking.”*
