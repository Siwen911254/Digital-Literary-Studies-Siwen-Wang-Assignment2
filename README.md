First, I used the Open Library of the Internet Archive and downloaded the PDF version of Great Short Stories of the World (published in 1925). I selected the short story “Mrs. Bullfrog” for my analysis and performed OCR using Google Drive.

In the second step, I used Dillinger to convert the OCR output into Markdown format and cleaned the text. The cleaning process included removing page numbers, merging broken lines, deleting the table of contents, and correcting OCR errors. After that, I created a new GitHub repository, uploaded the cleaned text file, and named it text.txt.

In the third step, I carefully read the entire story and created the analysis.md document, where I analyzed the themes, narrative structure, narrative voice, and key passages.

Finally, I divided the story into three sections, created three separate text files for these parts, and uploaded them to Voyant Tools for quantitative analysis. I added the observations and visualizations generated by Voyant into the analysis.md document.
